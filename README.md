This is a JavaScript project and that will hopefully bring mind maps to the web to provide a new experience in conversation threads. As soon as I had realized that mind maps where chest much more elegant and glorified outlines, I knew I had to design this in order to make forums a much more approachable (and aesthetically pleasing) thing. Originally, this was going to go on a browser extension but will be going into a bookmarklet as well to provide the same experience for mobile users as well.

### Upcoming Changes

- The mind mapping algorithm needs to be tweaked so the child nodes come out of the threats that they belong to instead of the root.
- Design improvements in the CSS to make it a linked bubble sort of interphase.
- The mind map will be placed into a div to allow the user to look at the webpage through that lens but be able to quickly return back to the original view.
